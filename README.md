# Gargant
A text adventure game engine

Gargant is an attempt at modernizing the text adventure game genre without losing touch with the games that inspired it.
A new parsing algorithm Gargant can allow for the simplistic Sierra Games commands (eg. USE LAMP, OPEN DOOR),
natural language commands (eg. I light the lamp, I open the wooden door) and anything in between. A user interface reminiscent of the
command line keeps the look and feel of old school text adventure games, but cleaned up. Basic spell correction using Leveshtein Distances
as well as several future features will help to take away some of the confusion and frustration so prevelent in the genre for newcomers.
A filter to one object identificate algorithm dynamically changes the ways the player can refer to the game world. The game uses a custom
markup language to allow for events and items to respond to player actions on the game world.

Upcoming features.
Hierarchal attribute system to allow for adjective inheritence (eg. All gold items are metallic)
Quick access menu for basic verbs and inventory items
Text animation for more visually interesting events
